## Welcome!

I'm an automation specialist who also understands the danger of spending 8 hours trying to automate a [5-hour task](https://www.xkcd.com/1205/).

My favorite project so far is this [MVP](https://github.com/jacoblarget/waitlisters) of a full-stack real-time waitlist application I collaborated on for my Software Engineering Class. I attribute my ability to quickly drive efficiency in my work as a service administrator to thinking through the complexities of a well-normalized user permissions database for this project.

I'm additionally proud of this [R Shiny application](https://github.com/jacoblarget/chemical-position-visualizer) that helps visualize a chemical interaction dataset.

Currently, some things I'm working on are:
- an entry in the 2024 UW-Madison Machine Learning Marathon, focused on [primary leaf vein detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/infected-tomato-leaf-vein-segmentation/overview).
- a [refactor](https://github.com/jacoblarget/office-ours) of the waitlist application with a more legitimate authentication solution.
- a digital version of 3M's [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire) to see how UI upgrades can improve gameplay by automatically calculating stock prices and remaining counts.
