## Welcome!

I'm interested in using human-computer interaction to improve how and what we learn.

My favorite project so far is [this R Shiny application](https://github.com/jacoblarget/chemical-position-visualizer) that helps visualize a set of chemical position data.

Currently, here are some things I'm working on:
- an interactive sagittal section [inspired by this](http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~s0949176/sammy/) with more features to help teach phonetics.
- a digital version of 3M's game [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire), since I believe learning doesn't have to be separate from fun.
