## Welcome!

I'm interested in using human-computer interaction to improve how and what we learn.

My favorite project so far is [this MVP of an office hours application](https://github.com/jacoblarget/waitlisters) I created for my Software Engineering class, and started to [refactor with a more legitimate authentication solution after graduation.](https://github.com/jacoblarget/office-ours)

I'm additionally proud of this [R Shiny application](https://github.com/jacoblarget/chemical-position-visualizer) that helps visualize a chemical interaction dataset.

Currently, here are some things I'm working on:
- an extension of this [interactive sagittal section](http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~s0949176/sammy/) that allows for stringing together several IPA characters to animate the section and help teach phonetics.
- a digital version of 3M's game [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire) to see how UI upgrades can improve gameplay by taking care of stock prices and counts so players can focus on the strategy.
