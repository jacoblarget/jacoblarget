## Welcome!

I'm an automation specialist who also understands that there is nothing quite as inefficient as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all :)

My favorite project so far is this [MVP](https://github.com/jacoblarget/waitlisters) of a full-stack office hours waitlist application I collaborated on for my Software Engineering Class.

I'm additionally proud of this [R Shiny application](https://github.com/jacoblarget/chemical-position-visualizer) that helps visualize a chemical interaction dataset.

Currently, some things I'm working on are:
- a [refactor](https://github.com/jacoblarget/office-ours) of the waitlist application with a more legitimate authentication solution.
- a digital version of 3M's [Acquire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquire) to see how UI upgrades can improve gameplay by automatically calculating stock prices and remaining counts.
